Turkish SentiNet (HisNet) is a Turkish polarity dictionary made up of 80.000 synsets (sets of synonymous words and expressions). Polarity dictionaries are corpora in which the entries are categorized into three groups: positive, neutral and negative. This resource is meant to be used for sentiment analysis, in which a text can be evaluated in terms of its judgements of positive or negative meaning.
